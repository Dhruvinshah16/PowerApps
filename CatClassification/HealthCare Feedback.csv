155,Facilities, The Hospital grounds are stunning and the hospital itself is of a incredible high standard.
154,"Staff,Care","A lack of communication between Consultant and Nursing staff, led to me having to read my own notes to find out what had been done  during  my operation.  This is due to the nursing staff not being able to read the consultants notes, and then stating I would have to ask the consultant myself 6 weeks later at my follow  up appointment."
153,Staff,"the food was lovely,my consultant is a nice guy very thorough"
152,Staff,My son was treated although was only a day he was offered overnight but he wanted to get home.  The nurses and doctors were very friendly and put my son at ease he wasn't worried about his knee operation at all.  A fantastic hospital.

131,"Staff,Facilities","Fantastic doctors, clean rooms. My only complaint is about the food."

117,"Facilities,Care",I was taken care very fast and professionally. My only comment is on the toilet-like smell at the waiting room. They should try to fix that.
111,Care,My blood pressure is higher after my treatment than before. What a joke
110,Check-in,I was checked-in by a robot. Totally smooth experience. What a modern hospital!
109,"Facilities,Staff,Care","Nice and clean hospital. The facilities are great as well as the staffs working in the cafe. But I felt really rushed by the midwives and doctors. Besides, I felt I'm like talking to robots who are just getting their jobs done than showing any concerns for their patients."
108,"Facilities,Staff",This hospital is amazing! The staff is very friendly and will always give you a smile when you walk by. The facility is beautiful and pretty much brand new! 
107,"Staff,Care",Mom is under care in the ICU. Lack of communication amongst nurses and in documenting patient notes. Some of the nurses on the 3rd floor are extremely rude and unprofessional. Very disappointed

104,"Staff,Care",One of the worst hospitals in town. They have a very very laid back attitude regardless of the urgency of the medical situation. No amount of complaining/reporting has been able to resolve these issues.
103,Staff,"If you re admitted here, know they have wonderful nurses and nurse assistants but they are badly understaffed. They try to respond to you as best as they can, but they are clearly overwhelmed. Some of the docs are a little iffy, and seem to be overwhelmed too. "
102,"Staff,Care","This was my second time spending more than a week in the facility in the past 3 years. The staff is awesome, food is amazing, other than the fact you are in the hospital...it's a wonderful place to be, especially the rooms"

95,Facilities,"Never saw rooms that dirty, I was ahamed to have visitors"
94,Facilities,THE VENDING MACHINE STOLE MY MONEY!! I WANT MY CHIPS
93,"Care,Facilities",this is by far one of the worst hospitals that I've ever been in on this planet the nurses were great the hospital is in excellent condition very clean but the treatment from the Physicians was terrible I had to wait an hour before I was seen
92,Staff,Dr  could do a better job at explaining the different options. I coudln't understand him. Maybe because of his accent?
91,Facilities,The walls are super thin. You could hear everything your neighbors were saying...
90,"Staff,Care","The on-call doctor was very nice, despite some guests being rather rude."
89,Staff,People were friendly and my physical exam had positive result!
88,"Facilities,Care, Staff",Mixed review. The staff was nice. The wait was long but not horrible. But. I was made to wait in a tiny room off a hallway that looked like a people zoo exhibit in an ill fitting short backless robe with unshaven legs for 15 minutes waiting  
87,Facilities,I didn't find the elevators so I had to take the stairs each time I had to go out to smoke a cigarette. You should do better signalisation.

85,Staff,"I'm a bit disappointed with my first hospital experience, staff is less funny than in the movies"
84,Facilities,When was the last time those toilets were cleaned????

81,Staff,The doctor would spit on me every time he spoke. He liked to sit very close. Made me very uncomfortable.

79,Facilities,The magazines in the waiting room were at least a year old.
78,Staff,"I don't like the nurses at this hospital, they are spooky"
77,Care,I layed in a patient cart for hours in a corridor. I wanted to pee and couldn't ask anybody for help. 
76,"Facilities,Check-in",It was pretty easy to find the hospital and park nearby. I was registered pretty quickly (which is rare for an hospital nowadays) and had to wait 10 minutes to see a doctor. I totally recommend being sick in this hospital.
75,,"The food was totally disgusting, I wouldn't even give it to my cat"
74,"Staff,Care","Doctor was arrogant.  Anyway, he was no help at all and now I'm going to haev to go to another hospital for another scan. My brain still hurts and I'm not happy."
73,"Staff,Care","I went to this hospital today because I was suffering from a fever. I arrived at 9:30 am and I left 9:30pm. During that time, they gave me medication that you re supposed to take with food. In about 20 minutes, my stomach hurts. I asked three people for food, one being my doctor, to no avail. "
72,"Care,Facilities",Thanks for everything: I think I'm in good shape now after my surgery. I specially enjoyed your tomato pie and the good pillows
71,Facilities,My bedroom was sunny but a bit small. I would also have preferred to be in a single bed one.
70,Care,Best. Experience. Ever. For a hospital at least
68,Care,I was billed for $2000 just for an x-ray!!! Highway robbery.
67,Facilities,Great hospital but I didn't liked the curtains of my room because they were yellow
66,"Care,Staff","I had a learning doctor who had difficulties to perform my injection, fortunately an experienced nurse helped and it didn t hurt at all"
65,Facilities,Someone was smoking in their room and it stunk the halls.
64,Facilities,The TV was playing nothing but soap operas and daytime television and I couldn't change the channel. It was a nightmare.
63,,My neighbor wouldn't stop complaining that he didn't get jello.
62,,My neighbor got strawberry jello and I didn't get any. Totally unfair.
61,Facilities,The bed was too firm and I couldn't sleep at all.
60,Staff,I expected some nice doctors: was not the case: the guy didn't want to stop my bleeding nose.
59,"Staff,Care",I had surgery there yesterday and it was a great experience everyone was so loving and caring from the receptionist to nurses and my wonderful Dr  he is the best 
58,"Staff,Care","This place went down, use to be a great place to go for good quick service. Dr. was horrible waited 4 hours for 2 stitches and ended up walking out wit no stitches. Went to another ER and was out in less than 30 min. "
57,Facilities,Couldn't enter the nursery with my wheelchair
56,"Care,Check-in",I waited all day for the doctor and by the time she saw me I had stopped being sick and she told me there was nothing wrong and I should go home. What a total waste of time
55,"Staff,Care",Dr  was very understanding. The lunch and dinner that were served were very tasty. I do wish we had more people available outside of examination time to poke at whether results are available. 
54,,I may come back to this hospital just for the food. Best mashed potatos ever
53,Care,"If you wanna get an infection, this hospital is the place to go."
52,Check-in,It took four hours before I was helped. Not acceptable.
51,Facilities,The bed sheets had stains on them.
49,"Care,Facilities","I couldn't sleep during the night because of workers outside of the building. I asked the nurse for some drug but she didn't give me any. Considering the price, you should be a bit more attentive to your customers."
48,,"Breakfast is too light, and dinner was dry. Fortunately, I found decent snacking in the lobby. "
47,"Check-in,Staff","The organization of the service is breadth-taking. Everyone has their tasks, the process is rock-solid and very clear at every step of the way."
46,Facilities,"Toilets are dirty but lunch is ok and operation went well, which is the most important part of an hospital stay!"
45,Facilities,"Loved the room and the food was amazing, I've been in worse hotels before."
44,Check-in,"I've heard good things about this hospital before, so I was really disapointed when I had to wait 5 hours to see a doctor."
43,Staff,"It was one of the best hospitals I stayed in, specially the nursery. Staff was really kind and helpful."
42,Care,They sent me back home without even checking me properly. I will never come back here again.
41,Staff,"I barely saw my doctor, he came once and that's it"
40,Facilities,You guys need to spruce the place up a bit. Hospital white is such a clich 
39,"Check-in,Care,Staff","I don't remember much about the check-in (the drugs were really good!) but once I woke up in recovery, the staff were really helpful. Of course, noone spoke any English, but it's amazing how much French I can produce while drugged up to my eyeballs."
38,Facilities,The TV in my room was broken 
37,Staff,"The doctors were very professional, nurses were kind and attentive, the room was nice but the food at the cafeteria and in room is terrible "
35,,"We didn't plan to have Christmas dinner in the hospital, and won't be doing that again!"
34,"Staff,Care",My doctors were very professional and attentive to my problems. I'm very satisfied with the care and attention that I received. I wouldn't go anywhere else 
33,Check-in,I'm disappointed by the service. I had to wait 25 mins when I arrived before I could be shown to my room and I could settle in. I spend 4 days in the hospital and the rest went well but this initial experience was bad
32,"Staff,Facilities","Great experience, Betty was very friendly and took care of me during my stay. The room was nice and practical "
31,Care,You idiots amputated the wrong leg. I'm going to sue
30,Staff,Sarah is great and always smiling. She never complains and is always available. That made my stay so enjoyable
29,"Check-in,Staff","There are 2 lines when checking  in and it's not clear which one we have to use. One is for prechecking and the other for usual check-in. But is pre-checkin for people having already prechecked? Or for people trying to pre-check?  Why is nobody explaing it clearly? That being said, doctor was very nice and competent once we were able to meet him."
28,"Staff,Facilities","I'm so glad to be out. That being said, I can't complain about how comfortable I was in the hospital. The people around me were always available to help. When lying down, I could truly feel relief. "
27,Check-in,My son had issues with his knee.  We waited for 3 hours to see to doctor. 
26,Check-in,"When entering hospital, I waited in line for 45 min to sign up. And nobody apologized! Also, can you add television in the lobby?"
25,Facilities,There was a dead rat under my bed
24,Staff,"The secretary was grumpy. When you are on the verge of dying, let's say it's the last thing you need."
23,Check-in,"When I arrived, I didn't know where to go. The gynecology service were at the edge of the building, impossible to find with directions. "
22,Care,"If I wasn't going to die from my disease, I would have died from my experience in the hospital. They prescribed the wrong medication can you imagine?!!"
21,,My lunch was awesome. Never eat something like this. Chicken and peas at the same time ! :D
20,"Care,Staff",The nurses were very helpful and caring. At no point did I find myself alone. They provided food that was very good. 
19,Facilities,The room was dirty all the week and no one came to clean it. It is the second time this happens for me in this hospital
18,"Staff,Facilities","Fantastic doctors, clean rooms. My only complaint is about the food."
17,,"My only piece of feedback is about the food, horrible, taste-less food is served. Makes you want to recover fast to get out of the hospital and eat any other thing but that."
16,"Staff,check-in","Big kudos to the doctors and nurses, this is the most professional staff I've seen in a hospital ever. Even the staff at the check-in was extremely nice."
15,Facilities,"I was hospitalized and shared a room with 7 more people horrible smell. They could build smaller, individualized rooms."
14,Facilities,"Average hospital, I got my phone stolen during my stay there. Keep your valuable objects close by."
13,Facilities,"I'm super thankful for the care I received on the hospital, but the room was super cold, the thermostat was broken and it wasn t fixed during my stay.  "
12,"Check-in,Staff",Avoid this hospital at all cost! I went there with a horrible stomach pain and I had to wait THREE HOURS to be admitted. Then the staff seems stress and was super rude. It was like being in hell.
11,Care,"Thank you for treating me so well, you literally saved my life."
10,Facilities,"Even my stay wasn't for fun, the architecture of this building is world-class. The food though is horrible!!"
9,"Staff,Care","What can I say, I got into the hospital super sick and after a great care experience I am now fully recovered. I want to highlight the great human care provided by the doctors and nurses, they made me feel not like any other patient but like a unique human being. "
8,"Staff,Facilities","I've stayed a few days in this hospistal and despite the great staff, I wouldn't recommend this hospital. The rooms and beds are old and need a refresh."
7,"Staff,Facilities,Care",Hospital is very clean and decent. Staff was wonderful. The entire night I felt protected and nurses were on point. I have no complaints. Everyone took great care of me.
6,Staff,The staff on the first floor are not friendly and it was mixed between my daughter file with a 12 years old file
5,"Facilities, Care",I was taken care very fast and professionally. My only comment is on the toilet-like smell at the waiting room. They should try to fix that.
4,Staff,"More than 2 hours after my arrival with a pain scale of 10, i was never examined. i explained to the e.r. nurse and was told all i have to do is get up and leave if i can't wait. so i did. very unprofessional and inhumane."
3,"Staff,Check-in",  After explaining in a non-confidential area to someone who is clearly not a medical profession the reasons I am here I am given a hall pass and allowed to enter.   I've been waiting over 30 minute past my appointment time. 
2,Staff,The guard at the front door was so kind and gracious.We needed a  wheelchair and he was there for us. Also assisted us upon departure.When we made it upstairs to radiology-the staff could not have been more sensitive and gracious. Even in New York! Kidding. The elderly woman taking theintake was only okay.
1,"Staff,Facilities,Check-in",Even though the recuperation was excruciating and uncomfortable every staff member I came into contact with from check in to discharge a week later was a high quality and stellar experience! You really felt that the team was in sync and incredibly kind and competent.
